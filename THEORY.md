## 1. Introduction and Core Concepts

### What is Lambda Calculus

Lambda calculus is a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application. It serves as the theoretical foundation for:

- **Functional programming languages** (Haskell, ML, Lisp)
- **Type theory** and programming language semantics
- **Computability theory** and theoretical computer science
- **Mathematical logic** and proof theory

### Historical Context

- **1930s**: Alonzo Church develops lambda calculus
- **1936**: Church-Turing thesis establishes equivalence with Turing machines
- **1940s-50s**: LISP implements lambda calculus concepts
- **1970s-80s**: ML and modern functional languages emerge

### Getting Started with the Interpreter

```lambda
# Load the standard library
:load stdlib.lambda

# Basic identity function
id = λx.x
id 42

# Function composition
compose = λf.λg.λx.f (g x)
double = λx.mult 2 x
increment = λx.plus 1 x
double_then_increment = compose increment double
double_then_increment 5
```

---

## 2. Basic Syntax and Semantics

### 2.1 Core Grammar

The untyped lambda calculus has only three constructs:

```text
Expression E ::= x          (variable)
               | λx.E       (abstraction/function definition)
               | E₁ E₂      (application/function call)
```

### 2.2 Precedence and Associativity

1. **Application is left-associative**: `f g h` means `(f g) h`
2. **Abstraction extends to the right**: `λx.λy.x y` means `λx.(λy.(x y))`
3. **Application has higher precedence than abstraction**

### 2.3 Free and Bound Variables

A variable is **free** if it's not bound by any λ, **bound** if it's captured by a λ.

#### Mathematical Definition

```text
FV(x) = {x}                    (free variables in variable)
FV(λx.M) = FV(M) \ {x}         (free variables in abstraction)  
FV(M N) = FV(M) ∪ FV(N)        (free variables in application)
```

### Practice Examples

```lambda
# Free variables examples
x                      # x is free
λx.x                   # no free variables (x is bound)
λx.x y                 # y is free, x is bound
λx.λy.x y z           # z is free, x and y are bound

# Multi-argument functions (syntactic sugar)
λx y z.x y z          # Same as λx.λy.λz.x y z

# Arrow function syntax
x -> x + 1            # Same as λx.plus x 1
x, y -> mult x y      # Same as λx.λy.mult x y
```

### 2.4 Substitution

**Notation**: `M[x := N]` means "substitute N for every free occurrence of x in M"

#### Formal Definition

```text
x[x := N] = N
y[x := N] = y                           (if y ≠ x)
(λy.M)[x := N] = λy.(M[x := N])         (if y ≠ x and y ∉ FV(N))
(λx.M)[x := N] = λx.M                   (bound variable shields substitution)
(M₁ M₂)[x := N] = (M₁[x := N]) (M₂[x := N])
```

### Substitution Examples

```lambda
# Substitution examples
f = λx.λy.x y
g = f z                # Substitutes z for x: λy.z y
h = g w                # Substitutes w for y: z w

# Variable capture avoidance
tricky = λx.λy.x
safe_substitute = tricky y   # Results in λz.y (y-variable renamed to avoid capture)
```

---

## 3. Alpha Conversion (α-Conversion)

### 3.1 Theory

**Alpha equivalence** (≡_α): Two expressions are α-equivalent if they differ only in the names of bound variables.

**Formal Rule**: `λx.M ≡_α λy.M[x := y]` (if y ∉ FV(M))

### 3.2 Mathematical Properties

- **Reflexive**: `M ≡_α M`
- **Symmetric**: `M ≡_α N ⟹ N ≡_α M`
- **Transitive**: `M ≡_α N ∧ N ≡_α P ⟹ M ≡_α P`

### Alpha Equivalence Examples

```lambda
# These are all α-equivalent (same function):
id1 = λx.x
id2 = λy.y  
id3 = λz.z
id4 = λvariable.variable

# Test they behave identically:
id1 42
id2 42
id3 42
id4 42

# More complex α-equivalence:
f1 = λx.λy.x y
f2 = λa.λb.a b
f3 = λfunc.λarg.func arg

# All equivalent - test with same arguments:
f1 plus 5
f2 plus 5  
f3 plus 5
```

### 3.3 Variable Capture Avoidance

Critical rule: When α-converting, ensure no free variables become accidentally bound.

```lambda
# Dangerous (incorrect) α-conversion:
# λx.λy.x y  ≠  λy.λy.y y   (inner y captures outer y)

# Correct α-conversion:
# λx.λy.x y  ≡  λy.λz.y z   (rename to avoid capture)

# The interpreter handles this automatically:
test_capture = λx.λy.x
result = test_capture y    # Interpreter safely handles variable renaming
```

---

## 4. Beta Reduction (β-Reduction)

### 4.1 Theory

**Beta reduction** is the core computational rule of lambda calculus - function application.

**Formal Rule**: `(λx.M) N →_β M[x := N]`

This represents applying function `λx.M` to argument `N` by substituting `N` for every free occurrence of `x` in `M`.

### 4.2 Basic Reduction Examples

```lambda
# Simple β-reduction:
(λx.x) 42                           # →_β 42

# Multiple steps:
(λx.λy.x y) plus 5                  # →_β (λy.plus y) 5 →_β plus 5

# Church numeral application:
two = λf.λx.f (f x)
two succ 0                          # →_β λx.succ (succ x) →_β succ (succ 0) →_β 2

# Boolean logic:
true = λx.λy.x
false = λx.λy.y
true 1 0                            # →_β (λy.1) 0 →_β 1
false 1 0                           # →_β (λy.0) 0 →_β 0

# Conditional expressions:
if_then_else = λp.λt.λe.p t e
if_then_else true "yes" "no"        # →_β true "yes" "no" →_β "yes"
```

### 4.3 Complex Reductions

```lambda
# Function composition:
compose = λf.λg.λx.f (g x)
double = λx.mult 2 x
increment = λx.plus 1 x
compose increment double 5          # →_β increment (double 5) →_β increment 10 →_β 11

# Higher-order functions:
twice = λf.λx.f (f x)
quadruple = twice double
quadruple 3                         # 12 (3 * 2 * 2)
```

### 4.4 Reduction Sequences

A **reduction sequence** shows step-by-step evaluation:

```lambda
# Example: (λx.λy.x y) (λz.z) w
# Step 1: (λx.λy.x y) (λz.z) w →_β (λy.(λz.z) y) w
# Step 2: (λy.(λz.z) y) w →_β (λz.z) w  
# Step 3: (λz.z) w →_β w

# Try step-by-step in interpreter:
:step on
(λx.λy.x y) (λz.z) w
:step off
```

### 4.5 Redex and Normal Form

- **Redex**: A reducible expression of the form `(λx.M) N`
- **Normal Form**: Expression with no redexes (cannot be reduced further)

```lambda
# Redexes (can be reduced):
(λx.x) y                   # Single redex
(λx.x) ((λy.y) z)         # Two redexes

# Normal forms (cannot be reduced):
x
λx.x  
λx.λy.x y
y z

# Not in normal form:
λx.(λy.y) x               # Contains redex (λy.y) x
```

---

## 5. Eta Reduction (η-Reduction)

### 5.1 Theory

**Eta reduction** expresses function extensionality: `λx.f x ≡ f` (when x ∉ FV(f))

This captures the idea that a function and its η-expansion represent the same mathematical object.

**Formal Rule**: `λx.M x →_η M` (if x ∉ FV(M))

### 5.2 Mathematical Intuition

If two functions produce the same output for every input, they are the same function:
`∀x. f x = g x ⟹ f = g`

### Eta Equivalence Examples

```lambda
# η-equivalent expressions:
f = λx.plus 1 x
g = plus 1
# f and g are η-equivalent

# Test equivalence:
f 5                        # Results in 6
g 5                        # Results in 6

# More examples:
h1 = λx.mult 2 x          # η-reduces to mult 2
h2 = mult 2
h1 7                      # 14
h2 7                      # 14

# Higher-order example:
compose_eta = λf.λx.compose f id x    # η-reduces to λf.compose f id
compose_simple = λf.compose f id
```

### 5.3 When η-Reduction Doesn't Apply

```lambda
# These CANNOT be η-reduced (x appears elsewhere):
self_apply = λx.x x              # x appears twice
diagonal = λx.f x x              # x appears twice  
trace = λx.plus x x              # x appears twice

# Free variable restriction:
outer_x = x
cannot_eta = λx.outer_x x        # Cannot reduce because x is free in outer_x
```

---

## 6. Normal Forms and Reduction Strategies

### 6.1 Types of Normal Forms

#### Normal Form (NF)

Expression that cannot be β-reduced further.

#### Weak Head Normal Form (WHNF)

Expression of the form `λx.M` or a variable/constant applied to arguments.

#### Head Normal Form (HNF)

All redexes inside the "head" (leftmost function) are reduced.

### Normal Form Examples

```lambda
# Normal forms:
λx.x                      # Already in NF
λx.λy.x y                # Already in NF  
x y z                     # In NF (assuming x, y, z are variables)

# Weak Head Normal Form but not NF:
λx.(λy.y) x              # WHNF (lambda at top) but contains redex
λx.plus ((λy.y) 2) x     # WHNF but not NF

# Not in WHNF:
(λx.x) y                 # Application at top level
plus ((λx.x) 2)          # Redex in argument position
```

### 6.2 Reduction Strategies

#### Call-by-Name (Lazy Evaluation)

Reduce the leftmost-outermost redex first. Arguments are not evaluated until needed.

#### Call-by-Value (Eager Evaluation)

Reduce arguments before applying functions.

#### Normal Order

Always reduce the leftmost-outermost redex.

### Strategy Comparison

```lambda
# Test different evaluation strategies:
:lazy on                          # Enable lazy evaluation (call-by-name)

# This works in lazy evaluation (argument never evaluated):
const = λx.λy.x
omega = (λx.x x) (λx.x x)        # Infinite loop
result_lazy = const 42 omega      # Returns 42 (omega never evaluated)

:lazy off                         # Enable eager evaluation

# Demonstrate with finite but expensive computation:
expensive = λx.exp 2 10          # 2^10 = 1024 (expensive)
cheap_const = λx.λy.x
cheap_const 1 expensive          # In lazy: returns 1 without computing expensive
                                # In eager: computes expensive first
```

### 6.3 Confluence and Determinism

The **Church-Rosser theorem** guarantees that reduction order doesn't affect the final result (if it exists).

```lambda
# All paths lead to same result:
expression = (λx.λy.x) ((λz.z) a) b

# Path 1: Reduce leftmost redex first
# (λx.λy.x) ((λz.z) a) b →_β (λy.(λz.z) a) b →_β (λz.z) a →_β a

# Path 2: Reduce inner redex first  
# (λx.λy.x) ((λz.z) a) b →_β (λx.λy.x) a b →_β (λy.a) b →_β a

# Both paths converge to 'a'
```

---

## 7. Church-Rosser Theorem (Confluence)

### 7.1 Theoretical Statement

**Church-Rosser Theorem**: If `M →*_β N₁` and `M →*_β N₂`, then there exists a term `P` such that `N₁ →*_β P` and `N₂ →*_β P`.

This means lambda calculus is **confluent** - different reduction paths eventually converge.

### 7.2 Diamond Property

The local confluence (diamond property) states that if `M →_β N₁` and `M →_β N₂` in one step, then there exists `P` such that `N₁ →*_β P` and `N₂ →*_β P`.

### Confluence Examples

```lambda
# Diamond example:
start = (λx.λy.x) ((λz.z) a) b

# Two possible first reductions:
path1_step1 = (λy.(λz.z) a) b          # Reduce outer redex first
path2_step1 = (λx.λy.x) a b            # Reduce inner redex first

# Both eventually reach the same result:
# path1: (λy.(λz.z) a) b →_β (λz.z) a →_β a
# path2: (λx.λy.x) a b →_β (λy.a) b →_β a

# Verify in interpreter:
(λx.λy.x) ((λz.z) a) b                 # Should evaluate to 'a'
```

### 7.3 Unique Normal Forms

**Corollary**: If a term has a normal form, that normal form is unique (up to α-equivalence).

```lambda
# This guarantees deterministic results:
complex_expr = (λf.λx.f (f x)) (λy.plus y 1) 0
# No matter how we reduce it, we always get the same answer: 2

# Test multiple evaluation strategies:
:lazy on
result1 = complex_expr
:lazy off  
result2 = complex_expr
# result1 and result2 are identical
```

## 8. Fixed Point Combinators

### 8.1 The Y Combinator

The **Y combinator** enables recursion in lambda calculus without explicit self-reference.

**Definition**: `Y = λf.(λx.f (x x)) (λx.f (x x))`

**Key Property**: `Y f = f (Y f)` for any function `f`

### 8.2 Mathematical Proof

```text
Y f = (λf.(λx.f (x x)) (λx.f (x x))) f
    →_β (λx.f (x x)) (λx.f (x x))  
    →_β f ((λx.f (x x)) (λx.f (x x)))
    = f (Y f)
```

### Y Combinator Examples

```lambda
# Y combinator is built into the interpreter
# Define factorial using Y:
fact_step = λf.λn.if (iszero n) 1 (mult n (f (pred n)))
factorial = Y fact_step

# Test factorial:
factorial 0                     # 1
factorial 1                     # 1  
factorial 5                     # 120

# Define Fibonacci using Y:
fib_step = λf.λn.if (leq n 1) n (plus (f (pred n)) (f (pred (pred n))))
fibonacci = Y fib_step

# Test Fibonacci:
fibonacci 0                     # 0
fibonacci 1                     # 1
fibonacci 8                     # 21

# Infinite list using Y:
ones_step = λf.cons 1 f
infinite_ones = Y ones_step     # [1, 1, 1, 1, ...]

# Take first few elements:
take 5 infinite_ones           # [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

### 8.3 Other Fixed Point Combinators

```lambda
# Turing's fixed point combinator:
# Θ = (λx.λy.y (x x y)) (λx.λy.y (x x y))

# Z combinator (call-by-value version):
# Z = λf.(λx.f (λv.x x v)) (λx.f (λv.x x v))

# Self-application combinator:
self_apply = λx.x x
# Note: self_apply self_apply creates infinite loop

# Test with safe function:
double_self = λx.mult 2 x
self_apply double_self 5        # (mult 2 5) = 10
```

---

## 9. Church Encodings

### 9.1 Church Numerals

Church numerals represent natural numbers as higher-order functions.

**Definition**: `n̄ = λf.λx.f^n(x)` (apply f exactly n times to x)

### Church Numeral Examples

```lambda
# Basic Church numerals:
zero = λf.λx.x                  # Apply f 0 times
one = λf.λx.f x                 # Apply f 1 time  
two = λf.λx.f (f x)            # Apply f 2 times
three = λf.λx.f (f (f x))      # Apply f 3 times

# Test by applying to successor and 0:
zero succ 0                     # 0
one succ 0                      # 1
two succ 0                      # 2  
three succ 0                    # 3

# Arithmetic operations:
plus_church = λm.λn.λf.λx.m f (n f x)      # m applications, then n more
mult_church = λm.λn.λf.m (n f)             # m applications of (n applications)
exp_church = λm.λn.n m                      # n applications of m

# Test arithmetic:
plus_church two three succ 0               # 5
mult_church two three succ 0               # 6  
exp_church two three succ 0                # 8 (2^3)
```

### 9.2 Church Booleans

Booleans are encoded as selector functions.

```lambda
# Boolean encoding:
true_church = λx.λy.x           # Select first argument
false_church = λx.λy.y          # Select second argument

# Test selection behavior:
true_church "yes" "no"          # "yes"
false_church "yes" "no"         # "no"

# Boolean operations:
and_church = λp.λq.p q false_church
or_church = λp.λq.p true_church q
not_church = λp.λa.λb.p b a
xor_church = λp.λq.p (not_church q) q

# Test boolean algebra:
and_church true_church false_church "T" "F"        # "F"
or_church true_church false_church "T" "F"         # "T"  
not_church true_church "T" "F"                     # "F"
xor_church true_church true_church "T" "F"         # "F"
```

### 9.3 Church Lists

Lists can be encoded using the fold/reduce pattern.

```lambda
# List encoding as fold function:
# [a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ] = λf.λz.f a₁ (f a₂ (... (f aₙ z)...))

nil_church = λf.λz.z                               # Empty list
cons_church = λh.λt.λf.λz.f h (t f z)             # Prepend element

# Build list [1, 2, 3]:
list123_church = cons_church 1 (cons_church 2 (cons_church 3 nil_church))

# Test by folding with plus and 0:
list123_church plus 0                             # 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

# List operations:
head_church = λl.l (λh.λt.h) undefined           # Get first element
tail_church = λl.λf.λz.l (λh.λt.λg.g h (t f)) (λt.z) (λh.λt.t)

# Test head:
head_church list123_church                        # 1
```

### 9.4 Church Pairs

Pairs are encoded using the same selector principle as booleans.

```lambda
# Pair encoding:
pair_church = λx.λy.λf.f x y                     # Store two values
first_church = λp.p true_church                   # Select first element  
second_church = λp.p false_church                 # Select second element

# Test pairs:
my_pair = pair_church 42 "hello"
first_church my_pair                              # 42
second_church my_pair                             # "hello"

# Swap function:
swap_church = λp.pair_church (second_church p) (first_church p)
swapped = swap_church my_pair
first_church swapped                              # "hello"
second_church swapped                             # 42
```

---

## 10. Combinatory Logic

### 10.1 SKI Combinators

Combinatory logic shows that all computation can be expressed using just three combinators.

```lambda
# Basic combinators:
I_comb = λx.x                               # Identity
K_comb = λx.λy.x                           # Constant (returns first argument)
S_comb = λx.λy.λz.x z (y z)               # Substitution

# Test basic behavior:
I_comb 42                                   # 42
K_comb 42 99                               # 42 (ignores second argument)
S_comb plus mult 3                         # plus 3 (mult 3) = plus 3 9 = 12
```

### 10.2 Expressing Lambda Terms with SKI

Any lambda expression can be translated to SKI combinators:

**Translation Rules**:

- `T[x] = x`
- `T[λx.x] = I`  
- `T[λx.E] = K T[E]` (if x ∉ FV(E))
- `T[λx.E₁ E₂] = S T[λx.E₁] T[λx.E₂]`

```lambda
# Examples of translation:
# λx.x ≡ I
identity_ski = I_comb

# λx.λy.x ≡ K  
constant_ski = K_comb

# λx.x x ≡ S I I
self_apply_ski = S_comb I_comb I_comb

# Test equivalences:
identity_ski 5                              # 5
constant_ski 1 2                           # 1
```

### 10.3 Other Important Combinators

```lambda
# B combinator (composition):
B_comb = λx.λy.λz.x (y z)                 # Function composition
compose_example = B_comb succ (mult 2)
compose_example 5                          # succ (mult 2 5) = succ 10 = 11

# C combinator (flip):
C_comb = λx.λy.λz.x z y                   # Flip argument order
flip_minus = C_comb minus
flip_minus 3 10                           # minus 10 3 = 7

# W combinator (duplication):
W_comb = λx.λy.x y y                      # Apply function to two copies of argument
square_using_w = W_comb mult
square_using_w 5                          # mult 5 5 = 25
```

## 11. Type Theory Foundations

### 11.1 Simply Typed Lambda Calculus

Adding types prevents certain paradoxes and ensures normalization.

**Type Grammar**:

```text
τ ::= α              (type variable)
    | τ₁ → τ₂        (function type)
    | τ₁ × τ₂        (product type)
    | τ₁ + τ₂        (sum type)
```

**Typing Rules**:

```text
Γ ⊢ x : τ                    if x:τ ∈ Γ           (Variable)
Γ, x:σ ⊢ M : τ               ⟹ Γ ⊢ λx.M : σ→τ    (Abstraction)  
Γ ⊢ M : σ→τ, Γ ⊢ N : σ       ⟹ Γ ⊢ M N : τ       (Application)
```

### Type Examples (Conceptual)

```lambda
# If we had types, these would be typed as:
# id : ∀α. α → α
id_typed = λx.x

# const : ∀α β. α → β → α  
const_typed = λx.λy.x

# compose : ∀α β γ. (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ
compose_typed = λf.λg.λx.f (g x)

# These demonstrate polymorphic types
# (functions that work for any type)
```

### 11.2 Type Inference

**Algorithm W** (Hindley-Milner) can infer the most general type:

```lambda
# Examples of type inference:
mystery1 = λf.λx.f (f x)
# Inferred type: (α → α) → α → α

mystery2 = λf.λg.λx.f (g x)  
# Inferred type: (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ

mystery3 = λx.λy.λz.x z (y z)
# Inferred type: (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ
# This is the S combinator!
```

### 11.3 Parametric Polymorphism

```lambda
# Polymorphic functions work for any type:
# length : ∀α. List α → Nat
length_demo = length [1, 2, 3]            # Works for numbers
length_demo2 = length ["a", "b"]          # Works for strings

# map : ∀α β. (α → β) → List α → List β  
map_demo = map succ [1, 2, 3]            # [2, 3, 4]
map_demo2 = map not [true, false]        # [false, true]
```

## 12. Curry-Howard Correspondence

### 12.1 Propositions as Types

The Curry-Howard correspondence establishes a deep connection between:

- **Logic** and **Type Theory**
- **Propositions** and **Types**  
- **Proofs** and **Programs**

| Logic | Type Theory |
|-------|-------------|
| Proposition P | Type P |
| Proof of P | Term of type P |
| P → Q | Function type P → Q |
| P ∧ Q | Product type P × Q |
| P ∨ Q | Sum type P + Q |
| ⊥ (False) | Empty type |
| ⊤ (True) | Unit type |

### 12.2 Proofs as Programs

```lambda
# Proof of A → A (identity law):
proof_identity = λx.x
# Type: ∀A. A → A

# Proof of A → B → A (K combinator):
proof_K = λx.λy.x  
# Type: ∀A B. A → B → A

# Proof of (A → B → C) → (A → B) → A → C (S combinator):
proof_S = λf.λg.λx.f x (g x)
# Type: ∀A B C. (A → B → C) → (A → B) → A → C

# Proof of (A → B) → (B → C) → (A → C) (composition):
proof_compose = λf.λg.λx.g (f x)
# Type: ∀A B C. (A → B) → (B → C) → (A → C)
```

### 12.3 Classical vs Constructive Logic

```lambda
# Constructively valid (provable in lambda calculus):
# Double negation introduction: A → ¬¬A
double_neg_intro = λx.λf.f x
# Type: ∀A. A → ((A → ⊥) → ⊥)

# Pierce's law: ((A → B) → A) → A  
# This is NOT provable constructively!
# It's equivalent to the law of excluded middle

# De Morgan's law (one direction):
# ¬(A ∧ B) → (¬A ∨ ¬B)
de_morgan = λf.λg.f (λp.g (λh.p) (λh.p))
# This shows the constructive content of logical reasoning
```

---

## 13. Computational Complexity

### 13.1 Reduction Strategies and Efficiency

Different reduction strategies have different complexity characteristics:

```lambda
# Call-by-name can be exponentially slower:
expensive_example = λf.f (f (f 0))

# In call-by-name, this creates exponential blowup:
test_expensive = expensive_example (λx.plus x x)
# Evaluates (plus 0 0) + (plus 0 0) + ...
# Each subexpression is recomputed

# Call-by-value evaluates arguments once:
:lazy off
efficient_result = test_expensive       # More efficient

:lazy on  
inefficient_result = test_expensive     # Potentially slower
```

### 13.2 Space Complexity

```lambda
# Tail recursion vs non-tail recursion:

# Non-tail recursive (builds up stack):
factorial_bad = Y (λf.λn.if (iszero n) 1 (mult n (f (pred n))))

# Tail recursive (constant space):
factorial_good = λn.
  (Y (λf.λacc.λn.if (iszero n) acc (f (mult acc n) (pred n)))) 1 n

# Test both (large numbers might show difference):
factorial_bad 10
factorial_good 10
```

### 13.3 Time Complexity Analysis

```lambda
# Linear time list operations:
list_length = Y (λf.λl.if (null l) 0 (plus 1 (f (tail l))))

# Quadratic time naive reverse:
reverse_bad = Y (λf.λl.if (null l) nil (append (f (tail l)) [head l]))

# Linear time reverse with accumulator:
reverse_good = λl.(Y (λf.λacc.λl.if (null l) acc (f (cons (head l) acc) (tail l)))) nil l

# Test on moderately sized lists:
test_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
reverse_bad test_list
reverse_good test_list
```

---

## 14. Undecidability Results

### 14.1 The Halting Problem

Not all lambda expressions terminate. The halting problem is undecidable.

```lambda
# Classic non-terminating expressions:
omega = (λx.x x) (λx.x x)               # Infinite self-application
# omega                                 # Don't evaluate - infinite loop!

# Y combinator applied to identity:
infinite_identity = Y (λf.f)
# infinite_identity                     # Also infinite loop

# More subtle non-termination:
subtle_loop = Y (λf.λx.f x)
# subtle_loop 42                        # Infinite loop
```

### 14.2 Church-Rosser and Termination

The Church-Rosser theorem doesn't guarantee termination, only confluence.

```lambda
# Some expressions have no normal form:
no_normal_form = (λx.x x x) (λx.x x x)

# Others terminate in some reduction orders but not others:
# (This is complex to demonstrate without careful construction)

# Strong normalization: Some type systems guarantee termination
# But untyped lambda calculus is not strongly normalizing
```

### 14.3 Rice's Theorem

Any non-trivial property of the partial function computed by a lambda expression is undecidable.

Examples of undecidable properties:

- Does this expression terminate?
- Does this expression compute the constant function?
- Are these two expressions equivalent?

---

## 15. Advanced Topics

### 15.1 Linear Logic and Resource Awareness

```lambda
# In linear logic, resources must be used exactly once
# Standard lambda calculus allows duplication and deletion:

duplicate = λx.pair x x                 # Uses x twice (not linear)
ignore = λx.λy.y                      # Ignores x (not linear)

# Linear types would prevent these patterns
# and enable reasoning about resource usage
```

### 15.2 Dependent Types

```lambda
# In dependent type theory, types can depend on values:
# Vector : Nat → Type → Type
# concat : ∀(n m : Nat) (A : Type). Vector n A → Vector m A → Vector (n + m) A

# This enables very precise specifications
# but is beyond pure lambda calculus
```

### 15.3 System F (Polymorphic Lambda Calculus)

```lambda
# System F adds universal quantification over types:
# Λα. λx:α. x : ∀α. α → α

# This enables encoding of datatypes:
# Nat ≡ ∀α. (α → α) → α → α
# Bool ≡ ∀α. α → α → α  
# List A ≡ ∀α. (A → α → α) → α → α
```

## 18. Common Patterns and Idioms

### 18.1 Higher-Order Function Patterns

```lambda
# Function composition pipeline
pipeline = λx.
  x |> double 
    |> increment 
    |> (λy.mult y 3)

# Currying and partial application
add = λx.λy.plus x y
add_five = add 5
add_five 10                    # 15

# Function factories
make_adder = λn.λx.plus n x
add_ten = make_adder 10
add_ten 5                      # 15

# Predicate combinators
both = λp.λq.λx.and (p x) (q x)
either = λp.λq.λx.or (p x) (q x)
is_positive = λx.gt x 0
is_even = λx.eq (mod x 2) 0
is_positive_even = both is_positive is_even
is_positive_even 4             # true
is_positive_even 3             # false
```

### 18.2 Data Structure Patterns

```lambda
# Option/Maybe pattern for error handling
safe_head = λl.if (null l) nothing (just (head l))
safe_tail = λl.if (null l) nothing (just (tail l))

# Chain safe operations
safe_second = λl.
  bind_maybe (safe_tail l) (λtail.
  safe_head tail)

safe_second [1, 2, 3]          # just 2
safe_second [1]                # nothing

# Either pattern for error handling with information
left = λx.λf.λg.f x
right = λx.λf.λg.g x

safe_divide = λx.λy.
  if (eq y 0) 
    (left "Division by zero")
    (right (div x y))

# Result processing
process_result = λresult.
  result 
    (λerror."Error: " ++ error)
    (λvalue."Result: " ++ (show value))

process_result (safe_divide 10 2)   # "Result: 5"
process_result (safe_divide 10 0)   # "Error: Division by zero"
```

### 18.3 Recursion Patterns

```lambda
# Tail recursion with accumulator
sum_list_tail = λl.
  (Y (λf.λacc.λl.
    if (null l) 
      acc 
      (f (plus acc (head l)) (tail l)))) 0 l

# Mutual recursion using Y
is_even_odd = Y (λf.
  let is_even = λn.if (eq n 0) true (second (f (pred n))) in
  let is_odd = λn.if (eq n 0) false (first (f (pred n))) in
  pair is_even is_odd)

is_even = first is_even_odd
is_odd = second is_even_odd

is_even 4                      # true
is_odd 4                       # false

# Structural recursion on trees
tree_depth = Y (λf.λt.
  t 
    0                          # Leaf case
    (λl.λx.λr.plus 1 (max (f l) (f r))))  # Node case
```

### 18.4 Functional Programming Idioms

```lambda
# Point-free style
sum_of_squares = compose (fold plus 0) (map (λx.mult x x))
sum_of_squares [1, 2, 3, 4]    # 30

# Applicative style
apply_to_both = λf.λx.λy.pair (f x) (f y)
apply_to_both succ 5 10        # (6, 11)

# Monadic style (using Maybe)
add_maybes = λmx.λmy.
  bind_maybe mx (λx.
  bind_maybe my (λy.
  return_maybe (plus x y)))

add_maybes (just 5) (just 3)   # just 8
add_maybes (just 5) nothing    # nothing

# Lens pattern for data access
get_first = λpair.first pair
set_first = λvalue.λpair.pair value (second pair)
modify_first = λf.λpair.pair (f (first pair)) (second pair)

my_pair = pair 10 20
get_first my_pair              # 10
set_first 99 my_pair          # (99, 20)

```

## 19. Debugging and Optimization

### 19.1 Debugging Techniques

```lambda
# Use step-by-step evaluation for complex expressions
:step on
complex_expr = (λf.λx.f (f x)) (λy.plus y 1) 0
:step off

# Add trace functions for debugging
trace = λmsg.λx.(print msg x; x)  # Conceptual - print not available
debug_factorial = Y (λf.λn.
  if (iszero n) 
    1
    (mult n (f (pred n))))

# Use let expressions for intermediate values
complex_computation = λx.
  let doubled = mult 2 x in
  let incremented = plus 1 doubled in
  let squared = mult incremented incremented in
  squared

# Break down complex expressions
step1 = λx.mult 2 x
step2 = λx.plus 1 x  
step3 = λx.mult x x
final_computation = λx.step3 (step2 (step1 x))
```

### 19.2 Performance Optimization

```lambda
# Use tail recursion to avoid stack overflow
# Bad (non-tail recursive):
factorial_slow = Y (λf.λn.if (iszero n) 1 (mult n (f (pred n))))

# Good (tail recursive):
factorial_fast = λn.
  (Y (λf.λacc.λn.if (iszero n) acc (f (mult acc n) (pred n)))) 1 n

# Use memoization for expensive recursive functions
# (The interpreter provides automatic memoization)
fibonacci_memo = Y (λf.λn.
  if (leq n 1) 
    n 
    (plus (f (pred n)) (f (pred (pred n)))))

# Use native arithmetic when possible
:native on  # Enable native optimizations for Church numerals

# Use lazy evaluation strategically
:lazy on
# Infinite lists work efficiently with lazy evaluation
infinite_nats = Y (λf.λn.cons n (f (succ n))) 0
take 10 infinite_nats
:lazy off
```

### 19.3 Memory Management

```lambda
# Clear caches when working with large computations
:memo                          # Clear all memoization caches

# Monitor performance with stats
:stats                         # Show detailed performance statistics

# Use iterative algorithms instead of recursive when possible
sum_iterative = λl.
  (Y (λloop.λacc.λl.
    if (null l) 
      acc 
      (loop (plus acc (head l)) (tail l)))) 0 l

# Be aware of space leaks in lazy evaluation
# Force evaluation when needed to avoid accumulating thunks
force_list = Y (λf.λl.
  if (null l) 
    nil 
    (cons (head l) (f (tail l))))
```

### 19.4 Common Pitfalls and Solutions

```lambda
# Pitfall: Variable capture in closures
# Problem:
make_counters_bad = λn.
  map (λi.λ_.i) (range 1 n)    # All functions return the same value

# Solution: Proper closure capture
make_counters_good = λn.
  map (λi.(λj.λ_.j) i) (range 1 n)

# Pitfall: Infinite recursion without base case
# Problem:
infinite_loop = Y (λf.λx.f x)  # Missing base case

# Solution: Always include base cases
safe_recursion = Y (λf.λx.
  if (some_condition x) 
    base_value 
    (f (transform x)))

# Pitfall: Inefficient list operations
# Problem: O(n²) append in loop
slow_reverse = Y (λf.λl.
  if (null l) 
    nil 
    (append (f (tail l)) [head l]))

# Solution: Use accumulator for O(n)
fast_reverse = λl.
  (Y (λf.λacc.λl.
    if (null l) 
      acc 
      (f (cons (head l) acc) (tail l)))) nil l
```
