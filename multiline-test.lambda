# Test file for multi-line input features
# This file demonstrates various multi-line constructs that should work

# Simple lambda with automatic continuation
factorial = λn.
  if (iszero n) 1 (mult n (factorial (pred n)))

# Let expression with multiple bindings
let x = 1,
    y = 2
in x + y

# Complex nested expression
result = map (λx.
  mult x x) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Macro definition
:macro (square $x) => mult $x $x

# Arrow function syntax
add = x, y -> x + y

# Complex expression with unmatched brackets
numbers = [
  1, 2, 3,
  4, 5, 6
]
